## Admin Panel

For simplicity, the admin panel is currently integrated under the `/admin` route, protected by clerk's middleware.

To access it, you may need to manually modify your account's public metadata to include `role:"admin"` and customize your session token. Don't worry as this is read-only, and cannot be modified by users. Further instructions can be found [here](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/basic-rbac).

In larger, more scalable applications, it might be preferable to separate the admin panel into its own build, hosted under an `admin.` subdomain. However, for this simple side project, maintaining two separate builds would be a bit overkill.
