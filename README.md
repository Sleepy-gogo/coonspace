## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- bun (recommended) or pnpm/npm/yarn
- Accounts for the following services:
  - [Clerk](https://clerk.dev) (Authentication)
  - [Turso](https://turso.tech) (Database)
  - [UploadThing](https://uploadthing.com) (File Storage)
  - [PostHog](https://posthog.com) (Analytics)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sleepy-gogo/coonspace.git
   cd coonspace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `.env.local` with your service credentials:
   - Clerk API keys
   - Turso database URL and auth token
   - UploadThing API keys
   - PostHog project API key (optional)

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** to see the app running

## üë®‚Äçüíª Admin Panel

For simplicity, the admin panel is integrated under the `/admin` route, protected by Clerk's middleware.

To access it, you need to:

1. Sign in with your account
2. Modify your account's public metadata to include `role:"admin"`
3. This can be done through the Clerk dashboard:
   - Go to User Management
   - Select your user
   - Add public metadata object with `role:"admin"`

For larger applications, a separate admin panel under an `admin.` subdomain would be preferable, but for this project, the integrated approach is simpler to maintain.
